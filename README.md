# Description

I created this program as part of a coding assessment during my job search. Its purpose is to read and parse given JSON data files that follow a certain schema, manipulate the data therein, and then output new JSON files (with a new schema) containing the modified data. Both schemas were made known to me.

I had no previous experience writing a PHP application from scratch. I gave myself a strict time limit of 2.5 hours to work on this challenge, so the program isn't perfect. Still, I am proud of how much I accomplished in such a short time, especially given my inexperience with the technology. The program is robust enough to handle incomplete or invalid data, and outputs useful error/warning messages depending on the data issue.
